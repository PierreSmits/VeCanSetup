This package manages Victrion VenusOs VeCan (aka CANbus) ports

NOTE: Modifying built-in CAN ports can render them unoperable requireing Venus OS to be reinstalled.

For this reason, built-in ports can NOT be changed by this script.
For example, a CCGX has one built-in CAN port, so only CAN1 can be affected by this script
but a Raspberry PI has no built-in ports so both CAN0 and CAN1 can be edited.
Cerbo GX has 2 built-in ports, so attempting add/modify/delete options will result in no additional prompting.

The setup script's actions are:

    Add - add (or modify) a port's configuraiton
        Configuration simply requires selecting one of the supported interfaces:
            CANable (both slcand and candelight firmware)
            Canberry Hat
            PCAN-USB (which is also the Victron's CANUSB)
            PiCan Hat
            Lawicel CANUSB and other SLCAN USB
            VScom USB-CAN+
            Waveshare Hat
    Remove a port's configuration
    Install the configured ports into the Venus file system
    Uninstall/restore all Venus files installed by this package
    leaving the system in a stock configuraiton


The script also hooks into SetupHelper's boot-time reinstall mechanism which reinstalls Venus file system modifications after they are overwritten by a Venus OS update

Two VeCan ports are defined for these systems: can0 and can1, although support for more could easily be added


Setting up a VeCan interface is a two-step process:
    select a port and choose an interface, or remove the configuration
    install the changes

Separate steps allow for review before changes are committed to the running system

Multiple interfaces of the same type is possible if serial numbers are supported at the udev level. 
For example, CANable with Candelight software supports multiple interfaces.

This script does it's best to determine the serial number, either from udev info or from dmesg (boot messages).

Those choices are presented as an option when adding the device.
If neither are appropriate, manual entry is offered as a last resort.
If no serial number is desired (recommended unless multiple interfaces exist),
reject both guesses and enter nothing at the manual prompt.

Using a different interface type for each CANbus should work OK

Note: I have only tested this package with CANable. CANbus hats that support two interfaces are at the most risk of working properly. The configurations for other interfaces was taken from

https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/RaspberryPi-CAN-Interfaces

and for USB interfaces, with my own exeperiences with CANable.


Setup:

The easiest way to install this code IF the Venus device has internet access is to run the following command:

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/VeCanSetup/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data
mv /data/VeCanSetup-current /data/VeCanSetup

If not, do the following a computer that does have internet access

click on this link in a web browser:
https://github.com/kwindrem/VeCanSetup/archive/current.tar.gz

rename the resulting .tar.gz file to venus-data.tar.gz
copy the venus-data.tar.gz to a USB stick,
put the stick in the Venus device and reboot.
When Venus boots, it will unarchive the file to /data/VeCanSetup-current

mv /data/VeCanSetup-current /data/VeCanSetup


You must also install SetupHelper

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/SetupHelper/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data
mv /data/SetupHelper-current /data/SetupHelper

or click on this link in a web browser:

https://github.com/kwindrem/SetupHelper/archive/current.tar.gz
mv current.tar.gz SetupHelper.tar.gz

rename the resulting .tar.gz file to venus-data.tar.gz
copy the venus-data.tar.gz to a USB stick,
put the stick in the Venus device and reboot.

mv /data/SetupHelper-current /data/SetupHelper

Note, you must do VeCanSetup and SetupHelper on a separate flash drive since they use
the same file name on the flash drive.

If you are installing multiple packages, SetupHelper need only be installed once.

Once both packages are installed run setup and follow the prompts.
/data/VeCanSetup/setup

You will need root access to the Venus device. Instructions can be found here:
https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access
The root password needs to be reentered following a Venus update.
Setting up an authorization key (see documentation referenced above) will save time and avoid having to reset the root password after each update.
